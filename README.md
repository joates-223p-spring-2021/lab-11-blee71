# Lab-11 - Alien Invasion
Alien Invasion is a popular arcade game. This game has been created by following the "Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition" Book.

## Introduction
> In Alien Invasion, the user controls the ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The user can play this game by using the left/right arrow key on the keyboard and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the user presses **Play**, a fleet of alien spaceships fill the area and moves across down the screen through attack mode. The user's objective is to destroy the alien spaceships by shooting them. If the user shoots them all without getting close to its ship, a new fleet of alien spacehips will appear to move faster than the previous alien fleet. If any alien spacehip collides with the user's ship, the user loses a ship on the top left corner. If the user loses all three of them, the game ends.
